**State and District  Data Analysis**
This repository contains population data organized by state and district. 
The dataset includes detailed demographic statistics for each district, including total population, urban population, population under 6 years old, and other relevant metrics.
STATCD	The state code (unique identifier for each state).
DISTCD	The district code (unique identifier for each district).
STATNAME	The name of the state.
DISTNAME	The name of the district.
DISTRICTS	The total number of districts in the state.
BLOCKS	The total number of blocks in the district.
VILLAGES	The total number of villages in the district.
CLUSTERS	The number of administrative clusters in the district.
TOTPOPULAT	The total population of the district.
P_URB_POP	The urban population of the district.
POPULATION_0_6	The population under the age of 6 years in the district.
GROWTHRATE	The population growth rate for the district.
SEXRATIO	The sex ratio (number of females per 1000 males) in the district.
**Data Structure**
The dataset is structured with a record for each district in the country, with corresponding information for each year (AC_YEAR).
State-wise Data: The dataset is first organized by states, allowing you to filter or analyze data on a state level.
District-wise Data: Within each state, the data is further broken down by districts, allowing for a more granular analysis of demographic trends.
**Analysis Ideas**
Here are some ways you can analyze the data:
State-level Analysis:  aggregate the data to analyze population growth trends at the state level. For example, you can calculate the average growth rate or compare the sex ratio between states.
District-level Analysis: district-specific trends, like the urban population percentage, the number of blocks, and the number of villages.
Demographic Trends: Use the data to assess changes in the population  old over time and in different regions.
Sex Ratio Analysis: Track gender equality by analyzing the sex ratio across states and districts.
State-Level Population Trends: Create a line chart to track total population and growth rates at the state level over time.
District-Level Comparison: Use bar charts to compare districts within a state by population, sex ratio, or number of villages.
Urban vs Rural: Create a pie chart to show the proportion of urban vs. rural population in each district or state.
Demographic Analysis: Use demographic data like POPULATION_0_6 to assess trends in young populations.
